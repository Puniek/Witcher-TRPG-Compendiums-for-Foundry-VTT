      "name": "Megascope",
      "description": "A Megascope must be arranged in a wide circle on a flat surface and activated by a person with a Vigor Threshold of at least 1. No special ritual is required to activate a Megascope. Once activated the Megascope can be used in one of two ways. Firstly, the Megascope can be used to contact another person with a Megascope or Telecommunicator. There is no earthly limit to the distance of communication, but a Megascope cannot facilitate communication with things beyond the dimension in which it is used. The recipient of the communication can choose to answer the communication; in which case the Megascope creates a spectral form of the recipient within the circle, allowing communication as if the participants were in the same room. Secondly, a Megascope can, with a DC:16 Spell Casting check, be used to view a person the user has a strong emotional connection to. If the person being viewed is a mage they can sense the augury if they roll a Magic Training check that beats your initial Spell Casting check, but they cannot see who is spying on them. This remote viewing can be maintained for up to 10 minutes before the connection fades and the user must keep all of their focus on the megascope.\n\nAdditionally, once a connection has been established, a Megascope can act as a channel for teleportation. While your Megascope is connected to or remotely viewing a person, you can cast the Teleportation or Standing Portal spells to transport yourself to that location. If using teleportation, there is no Spell Casting check required to teleport. Unfortunately, the complex nature of the Megascope means that it must be in perfect working order for it to be safely utilized. If one of the Gemstones in a Megascope is damaged in even the slightest way the Megascope becomes unstable. A gemstone can be damaged by being struck, knocked out of the Megascope, scratched, or anything else that might mar its perfect surface. Additionally, due to the highly magical nature of a Megascope, bringing any amount of Dimeritium within 3m of a Megascope will damage all the Gemstones at a nearly imperceptible level.\n\nIf this happens while you are communicating with someone or you attempt to activate the Megascope with a damaged or imperfect gemstone, the image just become a bit shakier than usual requiring a DC:20 Awareness check to notice. However, the real danger comes when trying to remotely view a target or teleport through a damaged Megascope. If you attempt to remotely view a target through a damaged Megascope the DC raises to 25 and if you fail to beat this check any damaged gemstones in the Megascope explode, dealing 1d6 damage to every location on the body of anyone within 4m. This renders the Megascope useless until the Perfect Gemstones can be replaced. If you attempt to teleport through a damaged Megascope far worse things happen. If you cast the Standing Portal Spell with a damaged Megascope, the spell automatically fails as though you had rolled a fumble with a value of 10 and all 3 Gemstones in the Megascope will explode, dealing 3d6 damage to every location on the body of anyone within 6m. If you attempt to cast the Teleportation spell within a damaged Megascope the magic begins to rend you apart violently. Anyone within the range of their SPD Statistic has one chance to make a DC:14 Athletics check to remove the damaged crystal before your body is torn apart and the individual pieces lie scattered across the Continent. If they succeed, the Megascope powers down and you are unharmed. If they fail, you die a messy death.\n\nEducation DC:14 to determine nature."

Power Stone Guardians can take many forms such as doors, statues, or even chandeliers. The consensus seems to be that a power stone guardian must be made from an object sturdy enough to resist accidental destruction. The power stone within this object emits a faint magical aura that becomes stronger the closer it is, meaning that a mage can detect one with Magic Training and a Witcher’s Medallion will vibrate when near one.\n\nA power stone needs to be attuned to someone. The creator of this object can attune it to someone else, who then has the power to attune it to others by placing their hands on the stone. In large cities, you will find that almost all noble houses are guarded by Power Stone Guardians of some form and even some middle class residences may have one guarding their valuables. There are as many types of power stone guardians as there are paranoid mages, but the three presented here are the most common.\n\n◆ Alarm Power Stone: When an unattuned creature moves within 6m of the stone, it sends a telepathic message to those attuned to it. The stone can only alert the attuned creatures that someone has entered the area but cannot tell them who the intruders are. \n◆ Arcing Power Stone: When an unattuned creature comes within 6m of the stone, it immediately rolls an attack at a base 10 to release a small bolt of lightning that deals 2d6 damage. This attack can be dodged or blocked with a shield. After this point the Arcing Power Stone enters the initiative order at the bottom and attacks every round so long as an unattuned person remains in the area. \n◆ Illusion Power Stone: When an unattuned creature comes within 2m of the stone, the magic inside creates an illusory guard who appears to have just come onto the scene within 10m. The guard is dressed and armed in the manner dictated when the power stone is created. The illusion can shout a short phrase and can move about within 10m of the stone. The illusion cannot interact with anything otherwise, nor can it damage anything. The illusion lasts for 8 hours, or until dispelled.\n\nEducation DC:16 to determine nature."

While looking into the mirror, a person falls into a trance of sorts, seeing themselves within the mirror, enjoying the bountiful life just beyond the glass. These visions quickly become addictive and after gazing into the mirror once, a viewer must make a Resist Magic check DC:18. On a failure, the viewer is compelled to look into the mirror for at least 1 hour every day. At the end of each period, the viewer can make a new Resist Magic check. On a failure, the duration increases by 1 hour for the next 24-hour period. On a success, the duration is lessened by 1 hour.\n\nAdditionally, for every day that the viewer succeeds in not looking at the mirror, the duration is lessened by 1 hour. When the duration becomes 0 hours, the viewer is no longer under the magic of the mirror. If the duration ever reaches 24 hours, the viewer can no longer withdraw their gaze from the mirror even for basic needs such as eating and drinking. Without help, they are liable to die.\n\nIf the mirror is destroyed while someone is under its sway, that person becomes sullen and depressive for a month afterwards. They feel as though their life itself has been shattered and nothing brings them even the smallest amount of joy. This imposes a -2 to all actions they attempt.\n\nEducation DC:16 to determine nature."
